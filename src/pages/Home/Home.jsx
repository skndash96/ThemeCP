            ThemeCP is an experimental training system wherein users train on a perpetual ladder for rating ranging from 800 all the way till 3500. This system is base on two-hour, four problem mashups contest, ideally to be done everyday.

          Why does it work?

        <div className='description-2'>
          <ul>
            <li>
              ThemeCP lets you train with problems in the entire difficulty range you have a shot at solving.
            </li>
            <li>
              This balances difficulty and skill and keeps you in the "flow state", simulating your experience in an actual contest!
            </li>
            <li>
              Your built-in strengths and weaknesses carry a +- 200 differential on any given problem! Therefore, this system exposes you to problems in the entire range you could plausibly solve in a contest.
            </li>
            <li>
              ThemeCP’s goal is to increase your chances of solving such “feasible” problems in-contest and to increase your speed in solving such problems.
            </li>
            <li>
              Furthermore, ThemeCP’s high success rate, self-balancing at around 50%, keeps your motivation high. Failures increase your success rate (literally), and successes prove your improvement!
